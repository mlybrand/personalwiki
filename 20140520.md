Set up an instance of Gollum on my local machine that I can use as a wiki to take random notes in.  I tried this once before when I was doing a lot of PHP stuff and it was unsuccessful, but I still think it is a good idea if I can actually follow through with it.

In any event, Gollum doesn't install on windows, so I had to spin up a vm.  Once the vm was up and the port shared, it all seemed good.  However, I had to configure the vagrant box in the following manner:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y curl
\curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable
source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm
rvm requirements
rvm install ruby-1.9.3-full
rvm rubygems current
sudo apt-get install -y git-core
sudo apt-get install -y libicu-dev
sudo gem install gollum
sudo gem install redcarpet
git clone https://github.com/mlybrand/personalwiki.git
```

Additionally, there was an issue with using the wiki on github (since I wanted to sync this with github).  On github the links need to point to the file name (i.e. this page is 20140520.md).  But using the filename in gollum causes the server to server the file for download.  So I added some custom JavaScript to process the links on the page that end in .md and clips that off.  That seems to do the trick.  Here is the code I came up with:

```
window.onload = function() {
  var links = document.getElementsByTagName("a");
  for(var i in links) {
    var h = links[i].href;
    if (h && h.replace) { links[i].href = h.replace(/\.md$/, ""); }
  }
};
```
