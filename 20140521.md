* learned that in markdown add 2 trailing spaces to force line break  
* C#: .MakeGenericType called on Type and passing in a Type or array of Types used to make a closed type you can instantiate, ie:

```
var collectionType = typeof(List<>);
var itemType = typeof(String);
var closedType = collectionType.MakeGenericType(itemType);
var instance = Activator.CreateInstance(closedType);
```

* need to look for plugin for VS that lets you reverse engineer db into pocos and dbcontext.
