* learned that in markdown add 2 trailing spaces to force line break  
* C#: .MakeGenericType called on Type and passing in a Type or array of Types used to make a closed type you can instantiate, ie:

```
var collectionType = typeof(List<>);
var itemType = typeof(String);
var closedType = collectionType.MakeGenericType(itemType);
var instance = Activator.CreateInstance(closedType);
```

* need to look for plugin for VS that lets you reverse engineer db into pocos and dbcontext.
* That would be this project: EF Reverse POCO Generator [ http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/ee4fcff9-0c4c-4179-afd9-7a2fb90f5838 ]

* C#: .MakeGenericMethod was what I needed a while back and didn't understand enough to make it work:
```
class Something {
   public void Method<T>() {}
}

var thing = new Something();
var thingType = typeof(Something);
var methodInfo = thingType.GetMethod("Method");
methodInfo = methodInfo.MakeGenericMethod(typeof(String)); // for example
methodInfo.Invoke(thing, null);
```
