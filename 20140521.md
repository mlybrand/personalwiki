* learned that in markdown add 2 trailing spaces to force line break  
* C#: .MakeGenericType called on Type and passing in a Type or array of Types used to make a closed type you can instantiate, ie:

```
var collectionType = typeof(List<>);
var itemType = typeof(String);
var closedType = collectionType.MakeGenericType(itemType);
var instance = Activator.CreateInstance(closedType);
```

* need to look for plugin for VS that lets you reverse engineer db into pocos and dbcontext.
* That would be this project: EF Reverse POCO Generator [ http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/ee4fcff9-0c4c-4179-afd9-7a2fb90f5838 ]

* C#: .MakeGenericMethod was what I needed a while back and didn't understand enough to make it work:
```
class Something {
   public void Method<T>() {}
}

var thing = new Something();
var thingType = typeof(Something);
var methodInfo = thingType.GetMethod("Method");
methodInfo = methodInfo.MakeGenericMethod(typeof(String)); // for example
methodInfo.Invoke(thing, null);
```

* definitely victim of new, shiny syndrome. so, machine learning is a big interest of mine and Manning just came out with a MEAP I am interested in called Practical Probabilistic Programming, that applies ML and AI to data collected a web sites. Problem is that it uses Scala (and specifically its Figaro library).  This made me think of the Seven Languages in Seven Weeks that I have been meaning to work on.  And that made me think that that wouldn't be deep enough Scala stuff, so it looks like OReilly's Programming Scala book looks pretty decent (but at 852 pages, when would I have the time). sigh.
